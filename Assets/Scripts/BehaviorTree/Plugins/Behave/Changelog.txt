     - Improved handling of circular references.
     - Improved error reporting.
     - Changed name validation.
         - Underscores are no longer allowed in names - in order to avoid name clashes with pathed assets.

2.4.2:
 - Fixed some issues related to handling priority selectors in the recently update debugger.


2.4.1:
 - Fix corner case when restructuring library assets.

          - “Tester” component.
          - “Writer” component.

 - Behavioural change: Invert flag is now properly applied by the Priority Selector.
 - Debugger connection stability improvement.

 - Dependencies now shipped as separate (replaceable) files for minimal project impact.
 - Editor polish.
     - Added support for running multiple editor debugging instances on one machine.
     - Added focus-follow for debugger and canvas.
     - Added both scrollwheel/pad and drag-to-scroll support to all canvas views.
     - Drag connection to occupied input slot to replace.
     - Directly drag-drop trees from the sidebar onto the canvas as reference nodes.
     - Instant flag doesn't show on nodes connected to parents ignoring the flag.

2.2.2:
 - Addressed protobuf issue causing Parallel component completion setting to not get stored correctly.


2.2.1:
 - Fixed issue causing parallel components to fail compilation.


2.2:
 - Behavioural change: Support for multiple different action handler signatures is discontinued effective immediately.
    - Generated agent blueprint as well as accepted reflected signatures are now only:
        - public BehaveResult [Tick/Init][Name]Action (Tree sender);
        - public void Reset[Name]Action (Tree sender);
 - Added Tree class accessors - all valid only during an active init/tick/reset handler call:
    - string ActiveStringParameter
    - float ActiveFloatParameter
    - IAgent ActiveAgent
    - object ActiveData
 - Rather than waiting for the Unity bugfix, the built-in compiler API is now bypassed in favour of direct compiler binary execution.
    - An additional system-level mono SDK install is no longer needed to work around this Unity bug.
 - Tree.SetForward now returns boolean success value rather than logging error when passed unused action.
 - Full-library export now also available from the library settings in stead of menu-only access.
 - Even more UI polish: Better word-wrap, more contrasts for emphasis, instant flag hidden in unaffected scenarios and much more.
 - "Form new tree" nicely moves the new subtree up around the root socket rather than retaining the old position.
 - Default frame-rate of DebugUpdater now set to 20 fps rather than every frame. Gun safety and all that.
 - Massive codegen size save for larger libraries - from optimisation of tree-agent introspection codegen. Compile-time win.
 - More rigid parameter evaluation (remove needless occasional extra codegen).
 - Fixed copy and duplication procedures incorrectly not copying parameter values.
 - Force Unity to write serialised data before compiling.


2.1.1:
 - Fixed issue with tree paramterisation breaking debugger visualisation.


2.1:
 - Added autocomplete on action names, string parameters and component contexts.
 - Added mandatory actions (present in library regardless of use in trees).
 - Added partial library export and library merging / import-to-library.
 - Added Behave stripping - leave behind only a very lean Behave runtime, for redistribution or super slim deploy.
 - Added parameterised trees - get even more re-use out of your trees by overriding context and variables per reference.
 - Behavioural change: Tree.Reset will now delay resetting tree variables until after complete component reset.
 - Behavioural change: Tree.Tick will no longer automatically reset the tree upon completion. This plays very well with:
 - Added Tree.TickContinuously (int iterationCap = 1024) - ticks tree till completion or iteration cap is reached.
 - Added BehaveResult Tree.Result (bool value) utility function to side with Tree.Invert (BehaveResult value).
 - Added int Debugging.Local.ConnectionCount property - facilitating debug behaviour dependent on Behave debugger presence.
 - Moved default install path from Assets/Behave to Assets/Plugins/Behave.
    - WARNING: See Readme.txt upgrade guide.
 - Fixed decorator control node removal resulting in detached control connection.
 - Fixed decorator incorrectly not forwarding the instant status of its child node.
 - Fixed scenario where agent classes would get reflected for handlers even if blueprint derived.
 - Fixed unexpected corner cases of bad library configuration failing compiles (now causing warnings or simply being ignored).
 - Fixed Behave window breaking down when exiting play mode after having been active there.
 - Fixes to context getting incorrectly reset in some scenarios.
 - Fixed copy / paste functionality missing in some text fields.
 - Lots of UI polish and minor fixes.


2.0:

    - Keyboard authoring interface in addition to drag & drop.
 - Debugger upgrade.
    - Remote debugging.
    - Tick and reset.
    - "Unplug" for debugger-only control.
    - Breakpoints.
    - Action overrides - override the return values of specified actions.
 - Decorator rewrite.
    - Deprecated old decorator.
       - Still compiles, but cannot be added.
    - Decorators are now control-type components.
       - No specific decorator handlers on agents.
       - Control is achieved via third connection socket.
    - Two initial decorator types: Repeater and Interrupter.
 - Asset restructuring.
 	- No more collections - for nesting, use paths in tree names.
 	- New serialization format - see Readme.txt for upgrade instructions.
    - Collections are gone. Use Unix-style path names for tree organisation.
 - IAgent.Tick (Tree, bool) changed to IAgent.Tick (Tree)
	- Init calls can now only be handled explicitly
 - Full coverage online documentation and other community resources.
 - Countless fixes and polish items.

1.5:
 - Added Tree.TickActive - indicating if a tree is currently executing a tick or if it has completed evaluation.
 - In-tick tree reset requests now result in a reset at the end of tree evaluation rather than an immediate one.
 - Removed the legacy compatibility assembly (for compatibility with pre-1.2 assets) from the default distribution.
 - Fixed "X must be instantiated using the ScriptableObject.CreateInstance method instead of new X" warnings.

1.4:

 - Clarified wording on "library not loaded".
 - Now handling reset a bit cleverer - potential performance boost.
 - Changed the default success criteria of Parallel components from SuccessOrFailure to Success.
 - Added "instant" flag to components. Components marked instant will affect sequences and selectors when moving between child nodes. When a child node marked "instant" completes, rather than waiting for the next tree tick to tick the following child node, the sequence or selector does it immediately.
 - The compiler progress bar returns.
 - Editing a Behave asset now focuses the asset browser last instead of the tree editor.
 - Behave can now be installed in any subfolder of Assets - provided its internal folder structure remains intact.
 - Compilation speed improvements.
 - Enabled references across collection borders.

 - Runtime optimisations.
 - Enabled scrolling of the tree list in the debugger window.
 - Exposed Tree.ReflectForwards.
 - Added Tree.ResetForwards.
 - Added agent blueprints - connecting to agent handlers through virtual methods rather than reflected handlers.
 - Made connections selectable in the tree editor via the connection nub.
 - Moved connection managing from the inspector to the tree editor, where it is more visible and handy.
 - Added support for disabling connections - for faster, less destructive debugging.
 - Double-click reference component to jump to referenced tree.
 - Changed "Cannot update unregistered tree" handling from an exception to an error message. Still need more info.
 - Now showing string and float parameters in the tree editor if either is set.

1.2:
 - Fixed release building.
 - Added the priority selector, introducing the API points:
    - int IAgent.SelectTopPriority (Tree sender, params int[] IDs);

 - Added support for branch contexts, introducing the API points:
    - enum BL[LibraryName].ContextType { ContextName, ..., Unknown };
    - int Tree.ActiveContext { get; }
 - Changed IAgent interface:
    - Tick (bool init, Tree sender) -> Tick (Tree sender, bool init)
 - Added "Select asset" button to the standard inspector.

    - bool IsDecorator (int) -> static bool IsDecorator (int)
 - Upped editor performance.
 - New asset structure change with automatic import of Behave 1.0 assets.
 - Changed action and decorator handlers. These are now the handlers mapped:
    - public BehaveResult Init[Name][Action/Decorator] (Tree sender, string stringParameter, float floatParameter, IAgent agent, object data);
    - public BehaveResult Tick[Name][Action/Decorator] (Tree sender, string stringParameter, float floatParameter, IAgent agent, object data);
    - public void Reset[Name][Action/Decorator] (Tree sender, string stringParameter, float floatParameter, IAgent agent, object data);
